# TO-DO
What is a ToDo List? The definition is a simple one. It’s a list of tasks you need to complete or things that you want to do.
Having a list of everything you need to do written down in one place means you shouldn’t forget anything important. By prioritising the tasks in the list you plan the order in which you’re going to do them and can quickly see what needs your immediate attention and what tasks you can leave until a little later.

One of the most important reasons you should use a to do list is that it will help you stay organised. When you write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable.
